# Pied Piper Product Detail Page

In this application, I built out the product detail microservice for a online retail portal. I used ReactJS and vanilla CSS to create a beautiful and dynamic application. I gained a lot of experience with front-end development by creating various components in React, linking them together, practicing conditional rendering, etc. I also deployed this application to AWS using elastic beanstalk. Below I have included some images of the application!
