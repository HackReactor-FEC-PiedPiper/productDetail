# Pied Piper Product Detail Page

In this application, I built out the product detail microservice for a online retail portal. I used ReactJS and vanilla CSS to create a beautiful and dynamic application. I gained a lot of experience with front-end development by creating various components in React, linking them together, practicing conditional rendering, etc. I also deployed this application to AWS using elastic beanstalk.

Front-end react code can be found in `client/src` and CSS can be found in `client/public/stylesheet.css`
The basic Express server can be found in `server.js`

Deployed on AWS: http://productdetailmicroservice-env.eba-pwxyaeaw.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/



If the deployed AWS link does not work (maybe because I went over my AWS free tier limit for hours allowed per month), you can run this application on your local machine by doing the folliwing in your command line assuming you have git installed:

`git clone https://github.com/HackReactor-FEC-PiedPiper/productDetail.git`

Enter into the repo directory and then run:

`npm install`

`node server.js`

Then enter the following URL into your browser and experience the application: `http://localhost:3001`
